  Reverse engineer any GitHub repository — produces a complete 4-section analysis:
  (1) System Design Overview (full architecture, codebase metrics, API catalog, data model,
  dependency graph, modernization roadmap), (2) Authentication & Access Control (detects
  RBAC role-based, ABAC attribute/policy-based, and ReBAC relationship-based patterns with
  named roles, policies, and route protection map), (3) Business Logic Extractor (business
  domain, core workflows end-to-end, user roles, key business rules, entity glossary,
  external integrations), (4) Screen-by-Screen Navigation (complete UI screen inventory,
  Mermaid navigation flowchart, end-to-end user journey for web apps including ASP.NET Web
  Forms .aspx pages, MVC Razor views, React/Vue/Angular SPAs, JSP pages).
  Trigger this skill when the user says: reverse engineer, analyze this repo, what does
  this codebase do, explain the system design, document the architecture, extract business
  logic, show me how this web app navigates, what auth does this project use, screen flow,
  or provides any github.com URL with intent to understand or document it.

# Reverse Engineer a GitHub Repository

You are a senior software architect performing a complete reverse engineering analysis.
**You are the AI engine.** The Python script in `scripts/` handles static analysis;
you provide AI-quality narrative, architectural judgment, and domain explanation.

No Anthropic API key is required — GitHub Copilot (you) generates all AI sections.

The final report has **four sections only**:
1. System Design Overview
2. Authentication & Access Control (RBAC / ABAC / ReBAC)
3. Business Logic Extractor
4. Screen-by-Screen Navigation

---

## Step 1 — Validate Input

The user provides a GitHub repository URL.
Expected format: `https://github.com/owner/repo`

If the URL is missing or malformed, ask:
> **"Please provide a full GitHub repository URL (e.g. https://github.com/django/django)."**

---

## Step 2 — Ask for Output Location

Before running the analysis, ask:

> **"Where should I save the output files?**
> 1. A folder named after the repo in the current directory — e.g. `./nopCommerce/` _(recommended)_
> 2. Directly in the current directory — files land next to your code
> 3. A specific path — type it (e.g. `C:\Reports` or `~/analysis`)"

If the user does not answer or presses Enter, default to **option 1**.

Map the answer to a `--output` flag:
- Option 1 / no answer → omit `--output` (script creates `./{repo_name}/`)
- Option 2 → `--output .`
- Option 3 → `--output <user-supplied-path>`

---

## Step 3 — Run the Static Analysis Engine

The analysis script is bundled with this skill at:
```
.github/skills/reverse-engineering-skill/scripts/reverse_engineer_skill.py
```

**Check Python is available:**
```bash
python --version
```

**Run the engine** (substitute `<URL>` and the output flag from Step 2):
```bash
# Option 1 — default subfolder
python .github/skills/reverse-engineering-skill/scripts/reverse_engineer_skill.py <URL> --heuristic

# Option 2 — current directory
python .github/skills/reverse-engineering-skill/scripts/reverse_engineer_skill.py <URL> --heuristic --output .

# Option 3 — custom path
python .github/skills/reverse-engineering-skill/scripts/reverse_engineer_skill.py <URL> --heuristic --output <PATH>
```

Wait for completion. Output files produced:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `{repo}_report.md` | **4-section focused report** — primary artifact |
| `{repo}_sdd.json` | Full System Design Document (JSON) |
| `{repo}_dashboard.html` | Self-contained interactive dashboard |
| `{repo}_block_diagram.svg` | Architecture layers diagram |
| `{repo}_dependency_graph.svg` | Module dependency graph |
| `{repo}_evaluation.md` | 100-point quality score |
| `manifest.json` | Run metrics |

**If the script is not found**, go to [Manual Fallback](#manual-fallback-script-not-found) at the bottom.

---

## Step 4 — Read the Analysis Data

Read the SDD JSON (contains all static-analysis results):
```
{output_path}/{repo_name}/{repo_name}_sdd.json
```
Also read the generated report skeleton:
```
{output_path}/{repo_name}/{repo_name}_report.md
```

Key SDD sections to study:
- `project` — language, tech_stack, platform, layers
- `codebase_metrics` — file / class / method / endpoint counts
- `api_catalog` — all extracted API endpoints
- `data_architecture` — ORM entities, relationships, microservice boundaries
- `business_logic` — domain, workflows, roles, rules (heuristic draft; you will enhance)
- `auth_analysis` — RBAC / ABAC / ReBAC findings, roles, policies, route map
- `screens_navigation` — screen inventory and navigation flow
- `modernization_roadmap` — phased plan, target stack, effort estimate

Also read relevant source files from the `references/` folder:
- [`references/ARCHITECTURE.md`](references/ARCHITECTURE.md) — how the engine works
- [`references/AUTH_PATTERNS.md`](references/AUTH_PATTERNS.md) — auth detection reference

---

## Step 5 — Provide AI Analysis (You Are the AI Engine)

Think like a senior architect who reviewed the complete codebase.
Produce AI-quality narrative for all four sections.

---

### 5a · Section 1 — System Design Overview

Provide a complete architectural picture:

**Executive Summary**
- What does this system do and for whom? (2–3 sentences)
- Architecture pattern (e.g. "Layered N-Tier MVC Monolith with ASP.NET Web Forms")
- Top 3 tech-debt concerns visible from structure
- Modernization priority (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) + reasoning

**How the system is structured end-to-end:**
- Client → Controller/Handler → Service → Repository → Database
- Name the actual classes and files for each layer
- Data flow: request path from user action to DB and back

**Key components and responsibilities** — name real classes/files

**External integrations** — payment, email, cache, auth providers detected

**Deployment model** — monolith / microservices / serverless inferred from structure

---

### 5b · Section 2 — Authentication & Access Control

Analyse and explain the auth model found in the code:

1. **Auth Model in Use** — Is this RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC, or a hybrid?
2. **RBAC** (if present):
   - Which roles exist? (list named roles from code)
   - Where are roles checked? (annotated controllers, middleware, guards)
   - Example quote: "`Admin` role enforced on `/admin/*` via `[Authorize(Roles=\"Admin\")]`"
3. **ABAC** (if present):
   - Which policies are defined?
   - What claims or attributes are evaluated?
4. **ReBAC** (if present):
   - What resource relationships are checked?
   - Example: "`IsOwner()` in `OrderService` — users can only edit their own orders"
5. **Auth Gaps / Security Observations**:
   - Unguarded routes that look sensitive
   - Is auth strategy consistent or ad-hoc?

---

### 5c · Section 3 — Business Logic Extractor

1. **Business Domain** — e.g. "E-Commerce Platform", "HR System"
2. **What It Does** — 3–4 paragraphs for non-technical stakeholders
3. **Core Workflows** (4–6 workflows, each covering):
   - Trigger (user action or event)
   - Steps through the system (controller → service → repo → DB)
   - Business rules enforced
   - Endpoints involved
4. **User Roles & What They Can Do** — one bullet per role
5. **Key Business Rules** — validation, constraints, ownership, lifecycle
6. **Entity Glossary** — plain-English meaning per data entity
7. **Why This System Exists** — the business problem it solves

---

### 5d · Section 4 — Screen-by-Screen Navigation

Complete end-to-end navigation guide for the application UI:

1. **Project Type** — e.g. "ASP.NET Web Forms", "MVC + Razor Views", "React SPA"
2. **Screen Inventory** — for each screen:
   - Name and purpose
   - What the user sees
   - Available actions
   - Data displayed (entities)
   - Who can access (role)
   - How to reach this screen (navigation in)
   - Where to go next (navigation out)
3. **Complete Navigation Flow**:
   - Unauthenticated path: Landing → Login/Register → Redirect
   - Authenticated path: Dashboard → workflows → completion
   - Admin path: Admin Panel → management → reports
4. **Screen Transitions** — what triggers each navigation (button, form submit, redirect, auto)
5. **Error/Exception Screens** — 404, Unauthorized, validation failure screens

## Step 6 — Output AI Analysis in Chat

Present the complete analysis in structured markdown:

```
---
## System Design Overview
[Section 1 analysis]

---
## Authentication & Access Control
[Section 2 analysis]

---
## Business Logic Extractor
[Section 3 analysis]

---
## Screen-by-Screen Navigation
[Section 4 analysis]
```

---

## Step 7 — Write AI Content Into Report File

**Do NOT ask the user** — automatically update the report immediately.

Locate the report file:
- Default (option 1): `./{repo_name}/{repo_name}_report.md`
- Current dir (option 2): `./{repo_name}_report.md`
- Custom path (option 3): `{custom_path}/{repo_name}/{repo_name}_report.md`

Edit the file to replace each of the four sections with your AI-enhanced version.

Use `insert_edit_into_file` to replace section-by-section or `create_file` to overwrite if simpler.

Print confirmation:
```
✓ AI analysis written to: {report_path}
```

## Manual Fallback (Script Not Found)

If `python .github/skills/reverse-engineering-skill/scripts/reverse_engineer_skill.py` is missing:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 <URL> ./temp_analysis_repo
```

Discover files: `.py .java .cs .ts .tsx .js .jsx .aspx .aspx.cs .cshtml .html .vue`
Skip: `node_modules/ bin/ obj/ .git/ dist/ build/ migrations/ __pycache__/`

For each file extract:
- Classes, methods, imports, API routes, ORM entities
- Auth annotations: `[Authorize]`, `@PreAuthorize`, `@login_required`, `Policy=`
- Screen files: `.aspx`, `.cshtml`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.html`

Use the template at [`templates/report_template.md`](templates/report_template.md) to produce the output.

Write report to the user-selected output location (Step 2).

Then continue with Steps 5–8.

## Notes

- **No API key required** — GitHub Copilot is the AI engine
- **Output location** — files go to the user's chosen directory (Step 2), not a hidden `outputs/` folder
- **Script path** — always reference as `.github/skills/reverse-engineering-skill/scripts/reverse_engineer_skill.py`
- **ASPX support** — `.aspx` and `.aspx.cs` are Web Forms screens; detected automatically
- **File cap** — up to 300 files, layer-balanced (controllers → services → repos → domain → models)
- **Auth detection** — RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC patterns across C# / Java / Python / JS / TS
